 Homewiork for week 6 weather app API


 Given a user that wants to be able to see the current weather for a city as well as the next few days

This page takes a city name as input and will get today's weather plus a 5-day forecast from Open Weather API

It will then save the query to local storage and update the list of previous searches for quick access

This webpage was created using resources from Bootstrap, OpenWeather, and jQuery

Room for improvement would be in error handling of bad values as well as prompting for a state/country in the case of multiple cities sharing the same name
